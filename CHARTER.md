### Meeting Times

- In Person: Tues 2:30 - 4:20

### Meeting Guidelines

1. **Attendance:**  
   Missing an occasional meeting is acceptable, but consistent absences without prior notice and/or explanation will be considered a violation of the team charter. For 2 violations, see [Minor Offense](#minor-offense). For 3+ violations, see [Major Offence](#major-offense). Acceptable reasons for missing a meeting include:
   - Injury
   - Illness
   - Family emergency
   - Work
   - Conflicting class schedule
   - Death (yourself or other)  

2. **Tardiness:**  
   A member who is late to a meeting must notify the team leader before the meeting begins. Being late to a meeting without prior notice will be considered a violation of the team charter. See [Minor Offense](#minor-offense).

## Communication

### Methods of Communication

- Discord
- Email

### Communication Guidelines

1. **Regular Communication:**  
   The team will communicate regularly to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This includes:
   - Regularly checking the team's Discord channel
   - Regularly checking the team's email
   - Regularly checking the team's GitHub repository

2. **Responsiveness:**  
   Members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours. If a member is unable to respond within 24 hours, they must notify the team leader. Failure to respond within 24 hours will be considered a violation of the team charter. See [Minor Offense](#minor-offense).

3. **Respect:**
   Respectful communication is expected at all times. It should be understood that all members are working together to accomplish a common goal. Members are expected to be respectful of each other's opinions and ideas, even if they disagree. If a member feels that another member is not being respectful, they should notify the team leader. If a member is found to be disrespectful, they will be given a warning (See [Disciplinary Log](#disciplinary-log)). If the member continues to be disrespectful, the team leader will notify the instructor.

## Response Time: 1 Day response for messages on discord.

1. Availability for meeting expectations
2. Response time to communication expectations
3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
5. Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
    - if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
6. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
    - must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
7. Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
