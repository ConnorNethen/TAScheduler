   A member who is late to a meeting must notify the team leader before the meeting begins. Being late to a meeting without prior notice will be considered a violation of the team charter. See [Minor Offense](#minor-offense).

## Response Time: 1 Day response for messages on discord.

1. Availability for meeting expectations
2. Response time to communication expectations
3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
5. Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
    - if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
6. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
    - must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
7. Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
