## Team Structure

### Member Roles
The team will be structured as follows:
| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Leader | The leader is responsible for the flow of the meeting and has a helpful role in the delegation of responsibilities. They are responsible for making sure that the team is on track to meet the goals of the project. They are also responsible for making sure that the team is working well together. |
| Recorder | The recorder is responsible for taking notes during the meeting, making sure that the notes are accurate, and that they are posted to the [#meating-notes](https://discord.com/channels/1037760541491474452/1042124710290411530) channel on Discord. They are also responsible for recording any disceplinary actions that are taken towards any team member. |
| Agenda Setter | The agenda setter is responsible for making sure that the agenda is posted to the [#meeting-notes](https://discord.com/channels/1037760541491474452/1042124710290411530) channel on Discord at least 3 days before the meeting. They are also responsible for making sure that the agenda is followed during the meeting. |

***Note:** If a team member is unable to attend a meeting, they are responsible for making sure that their role is filled by another team member. If any member is unable to fulfill the responsibilities of their role on a regular basis, they shall be replaced by group consensus.*

### Decision Making

The team will make all decisions by consensus. If a decision cannot be made by consensus, the team will vote on the decision. The decision will be made by a simple majority vote. If a tie occurs, the leader will make the decision. If the leader is unable to make the decision, the decision will be referred to the instructor.

### Deligation of Responsibilities

All responsibilities will be discussed and decided on by the team. Each team member will have the opportunity to volunteer for a responsibility. If there are no volunteers for a task, the team leader will assign the responsibility to a team member.

All responsibilities will be delegated equally among the team members. If a team member feels that they are being overburdened with responsibilities, they will bring it to the attention of the team. The team will then discuss the issue and decide on a solution.

## Meetings

### Locations

- In Person: EMS E270

### Meeting Times

- In Person: Tues 2:30 - 4:20

### Meeting Guidelines

1. **Attendance:**  
   Missing an occasional meeting is acceptable, but consistent absences without prior notice and/or explanation will be considered a violation of the team charter. For 2 violations, see [Minor Offense](#minor-offense). For 3+ violations, see [Major Offence](#major-offense). Acceptable reasons for missing a meeting include:
   - Injury
   - Illness
   - Family emergency
   - Work
   - Conflicting class schedule
   - Death (yourself or other)  

2. **Tardiness:**  
   A member who is late to a meeting must notify the team leader before the meeting begins. Being late to a meeting without prior notice will be considered a violation of the team charter. (See [Minor Offense](#minor-offense))

## Communication

### Methods of Communication

- Discord
- Email

### Communication Guidelines

1. **Regular Communication:**  
   The team will communicate regularly to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This includes:
   - Regularly checking the team's Discord channel
   - Regularly checking the team's email
   - Regularly checking the team's GitHub repository

2. **Responsiveness:**  
   Members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours. If a member is unable to respond within 24 hours, they must notify the team leader. Failure to respond within 24 hours will be considered a violation of the team charter. (See [Minor Offense](#minor-offense))

3. **Respect:**  
   Respectful communication is expected at all times. It should be understood that all members are working together to accomplish a common goal. Members are expected to be respectful of each other's opinions and ideas, even if they disagree. If a member feels that another member is not being respectful, they should notify the team leader. If a member is found to be disrespectful, they will be given a warning (See [Disciplinary Log](#disciplinary-log)). If the member continues to be disrespectful, the team leader will notify the instructor.

## Work Standards

### Participation

1. **Lack of Participation:**  
   If a member isn't participating enough, they will be politely asked by the leader to share more. If the member continues to underperform, they will be given a warning (See [Disciplinary Log](#disciplinary-log)). If the member continues to underperform, based on group consensus, it will be considered a violation of the team charter (See [Minor Offense](#minor-offense)) and/or the team leader will notify the instructor.

2. **Unpreparedness:**  
   It is understood that members will have busy schedules. However, members are expected to be prepared for meetings. If a member is consistently unprepared for meetings, causing a disruption to the meeting, they will be given a warning (See [Disciplinary Log](#disciplinary-log)) and will be considered a violation of the team charter for further offenses (See [Minor Offense](#minor-offense)). If the member continues to be unprepared, the team leader will notify the instructor.

3. **Disproportionate Workload:**  
   If the team finds that, due to the time constraints of the project and the number of members actively participating, the workload cannot be completed, the team leader will notify the instructor via email and in person with detailed logs of the team's progress and reasons for the workload being too much.

## Disciplinary Procedures

### Regarding Disciplinary Actions

Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group conscience, if decided by a majority vote.

### Disciplinary Log

The recorder will be responsible for logging any information on offenses committed by any member. This report will be sent out with the meeting notes every week so each member knows where they stand.

### Minor Offense

A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. Minor offences require the offender to be labeled as “Storm trooper” for their stupidity. The storm trooper is required to prepare a delicious baked treat good either homemade or store bought within the next two meetings. Failure to do so will escalate them to the next level of offence. A record of the minor offence and when the delicious baked treat arrived will be recorded by the group assigned note taker.

### Major Offense

A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. Major offences require that the offender be labeled as “Anakin Skywalker” for his treachery. Anakin Skywalker is on probation and his probation status is to be clearly documented by email including a detailed description of his offence. Anakin Skywalker may return to regular group member status upon a group consensus. If Anakin Skywalker commits another offence constituted as either minor or major, he will become a candidate for punishment and dismissal.

### Punishment and Dismissal

A group member committing enough minor and major offences will finally have gone to the dark side and demoted to Darth Vader. They will be referred to punishment and dismissal and will be given over to review by the TA and governing bodies (the Rock). An email describing the offences leading up to punishment and dismissal will be displayed along with testimonies from at least 2 other group members and a log of offenses. If available, the offending members work will be confiscated and termed as “belonging to the group”.
